/*
    You are given a binary string, s, consisting of characters '0' and '1'. 
    Transform this string into a palindrome by performing some operations. 
    In one operation, swap any two characters, s[i] and s[j]
    
    Determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the string a palindrom.
    If it is impossible to do so, then return -1.
    
    Note:
    A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, for example, strings "0",
    "111" 010 10101 are palindromes, but strings 001 10 11101 are note. 
    
    
    Example: 
    
    Let string s = "0100101". 
    The following shows the minimum number of steps required. It uses 1-based indexing.
    
    1. Swap characters with indices (4,5)
    2. Swap characters with indices (1,2)
    
    Now, the binary string is now palindromic. 
    The answer is 2 swaps.
